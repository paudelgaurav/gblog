**Starting days are probably the hardest**

## Initial selection

>The wand chooses the wizard. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore... If you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. - The wand law, Harry Potter

The above quote from Harry Potter struck my mind as just like in the Harry Potter universe where a wand chooses a mage instead of the other way. It is quite similar in the context of young programmers. Rather than diving into benchmarks and pros and cons, you should find out which programming language calls out to you.

The connection between language and programmer is complex, there are various ways where a programming language may choose a particular programmercode  Let's talk about the personality, if he works on the abstraction layer then programming languages like Python and PHP may reach out to him as he likes to get the job done. But if he/she likes to dig dip about the iceberg then statically typed languages like C, C++ may be suitable. But it doesn't mean programmer working with abstraction layers doesn't like to dig more. This is about the newbie who does not even know there are remaining parts of the icebergs.


### Inheritance
In many families, there might already be a programmer who has influenced the upcoming generation of programmers.
The new generation of programmers growing up under the influence of others may have opinionated thoughts about a certain language. He/She has probably seen his/her elders earning money or doing certain tasks with the same language. And it would be easier for them as well to learn that language as they might get a good mentorship. So in this case one might be inclined towards the language used by their elders. And what about the wand, in this case, even wands will be satisfied with their mage as it has already been introduced in that particular family.


## A leap forward
Now a programmer is not a newbie anymore, he/she has dived into the ocean and probably figured out about the iceberg. Now this mage may or may not be satisfied with his wand. The programmer has found out the purpose of different programming languages.
