**Starting days are probably the hardest**

In this post I will be sharing how did I choose my first programming language.
I have read somewhere which striked my mind was that, just like in Harry Potter movies where a wand chooses a mage instead of the other way. It is quite similar in context of young developers. Rather than diving into benchmarks, pros and cons, you should find out which programming language calls out towards you.

In my case I started learning C and C++ when I was in my seven grade and was fascinated by programming languages in general. 


In a world where everyone hates OOP, I find it quite fascinating although it provide some abstraction layers and hide information. But sometime you just want to get the job done instead of diving deeper. I am not particulary against more code but simple hates repiting code which invites many problems moving forward.
